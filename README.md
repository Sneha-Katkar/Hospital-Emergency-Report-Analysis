🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Using Power BI & Excel 🏥

Excited to share my latest project where I analyzed Emergency Room (ER) operations to uncover key insights that can help optimize hospital resource allocation and enhance patient care.

🔍 Key Findings:
✅ High patient volumes, especially on Mondays and during late-night to early-morning hours.
✅ Most frequent referrals to General Practice and Orthopedics.
✅ Moderate patient satisfaction levels—highlighting opportunities for service improvement.
✅ Diverse patient demographics with a near-equal split between admitted and non-admitted cases.

📊 Tools Used:

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Excel: For data cleaning, preparation, and analysis.

💡 This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can drive smarter decisions in healthcare—ensuring the right care at the right time for every patient.
